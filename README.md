# Default_Risk_Predictor
An analysis of a few different machine learning models that predict risk of default.

Libraries used:  
pandas  
pathlib  
hvplot  
numpy  
scikitlearn  
tensorflow.keras  



We discovered here that the K-means model would have been better suited for an unsupervised machine learning application.  Because the data is already labeled, it was unnecessary to attempt to find further relationships.

Assumption is that overfitting and underfitting cannot be observed due to the difficulty of creating new data.
